/*
Bubble sort is a sorting algorithm which uses a nested loop to 'bubble' the largest values to the top. It compares adjacent elements and swaps them if one is greater than the other. On each pass, it sorts/bubbles a single number. This algorithm is optimized so that it performs one less comparison on each pass to prevent accessing out-of-bounds elements and comparing numbers that are already sorted.

Time complexity: O(n^2) - quadratic
Space complexity: O(1) - constant
